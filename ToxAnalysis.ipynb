This cell line was used to screen Tox21 libraries for identifying and prioritizing the potential developmental toxicants that interfere Shh pathway. Conditioned medium-stimulated mode was used to screen for chemicals inhibiting Shh signaling.

I am using it because it's a beautiful way to bring together disparate toxicity data into a single summary number. I am happy to to speak about it more. The public *draft* of the method is available at https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-12/dcap-report_bosc-review_508-compliant_final.pdf and is in the process of undergoing scientific panel review.\n",

    "At this point we would start to apply uncertainty factors. I am not going to be this as uncertainty analysis is not especially prescriptive. Honestly there's a lot of scientific debate around that, and to quote my division director \"uncertainty analysis is a bunch of old, cranky toxicologists arguing over how many times to divide the number\". As usual, feel free to ask if you want to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as a starting point the human-equivalent chronic oral benchmark dose where 97.5% of studies said things would be fine was about 0.6 mg/kg/day. So...avoid drinking 0.6 mg/kg/day atrazine. And, again, uncertainty factors would bring this lower because we don't necessary trust the certainty of the database (divide by 10) or the endpoint conversion (have a bunch of toxicologists argue about whether or not to divide by 2 or 3). The uncertainty factors lower the dose to be more protective - regulating around where the science told us bad things will start to happen wouldn't be protective. There is uncertainty in our science, and the uncertainty factors are intended to protect against that.\n",

    "So, we see they probably applied some uncertainty factors or didn't completely align with what our database calibrated approach yielded, but generally there's concordance. I suspect that first study used a similar benchmark dose (~0.6 mg/kg/day) and divided by 10 for database uncertainty and maybe another 10 for interspecies variation? I'd have to track down the risk assessment. But notice how the RfDs are all close to our benchmark dose divided by some combination of \"divide by 10/3/2\" that we would apply during uncertainty analysis. That tells me the database method actually did a pretty spiffy job. "

    "To review:\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected the chemical atrazine due to its use as a common pesticide. The assigment was to select and/or develop some tools for characterizing the properties of the chemical. Given the premise of Human Chemical, I decided that simulating a workflow examining properties that a toxicity risk assessor might care about: the bioactivities, in vivo activities, and ADME properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Set 1: PubChem and Bioactivity data - I built a small wrapper for PubChem's APIs to access bioactivity data and flag it by search terms that might indicate activities of concern. It flagged developmental toxicity, which is definitely of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Set 2: PubMed, the literature, and language models - I built a small wrapper for manipulating some of PubMed's APIs to grab recent literature on atrazine and applied an LLM (BioGPT-3) to quickly generate a short statement of key findings. Based on this I was able to hone down to some studies that were relevant to the potential developmental, endocrinal, and ecological hazard. In a risk-assessment context I would want to take a look at those studies because they could provide new sources of data or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Set 3: Chembl, ADME properties - I built a small wrapper for accessing ChemBL (a data source for pharmaceuticals and therefore containing ADME information) to see if I could find anything on atrazine's absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. It was a modest hit, but we did learn that atrazine has a relatively low (~-5) LogKp, which typically indicates it isn't extremely well absorbed by the skin. So maybe less of a concern for folks spraying down the crops if they're wearing masks (we'd need to dig deeper into inhalation data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Set 4: ToxRef, DCAP, CTX APIs - I built a small wrapper for accessing the CTX APIs to gather information on the in vivo tox data that is currently public. To help interpret these collections, I applied a method very recently proposed by EPA for using database information to consolidate a single benchmark dose of the oral chronic toxicity of atrazine, providing insight into how concerned I might be about it entering drinking water or being eating along with the apples. We skipped uncertainty factor analysis because I don't have a sufficiently cranky toxicologist to argue about which ones to use, but there are ways to do it. Finally, we were also able to access the reference doses (RfD) in ToxRef which gives us direct knowledge of what risk assessors have concluded are the official toxicological values of atrazine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more that could be done, but I need to stop somewhere. The assignment seemed to push toward a cheminformatics approach in terms of characterizing toxicologically interesting properties, so I went with tools along those lines. If there's a desire for a more QSAR-driven approach or an examination of my accumen with machine learning, I am happy to converse or oblige."
